The goal of an Arduino-based alcohol detector is to measure and monitor the alcohol concentration in a person's breath, providing a reliable and cost-effective solution for personal and professional use. Utilizing sensors like the MQ-3, which is sensitive to alcohol, the device detects the presence and level of alcohol when the user exhales into the sensor. This information is processed by the Arduino microcontroller and can be displayed on an LCD screen or transmitted to a smartphone or computer. The primary aim is to promote safety by preventing alcohol-impaired driving and supporting sobriety monitoring in various settings.
