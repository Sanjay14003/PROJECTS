**Aurdino Alcohol Detector**:The goal of an Arduino-based alcohol detector is to measure and monitor the alcohol concentration in a person's breath, providing a reliable and cost-effective solution for personal and professional use. Utilizing sensors like the MQ-3, which is sensitive to alcohol, the device detects the presence and level of alcohol when the user exhales into the sensor. This information is processed by the Arduino microcontroller and can be displayed on an LCD screen or transmitted to a smartphone or computer. The primary aim is to promote safety by preventing alcohol-impaired driving and supporting sobriety monitoring in various settings.
**Effective Data Transmission for Opportunistic Social Network Community Detection Algorithm Based on Node Similarity**The primary objective is to alleviate congestion within DTNs, which commonly occur due to limited network resources and intermittent connectivity. It achieves this by dynamically adjusting the routing behavior based on congestion detection mechanisms. By continuously monitoring network conditions and detecting congestion hotspots, EDCD optimizes data routing paths to circumvent congested areas, thereby improving overall network performance and resource utilization. In terms of scalability, the EDCD algorithm demonstrates advantages due to its reliance on efficient relay selection mechanisms and topology-aware routing decisions
